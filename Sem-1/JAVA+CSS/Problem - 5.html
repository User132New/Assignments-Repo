          My dream vacation is to visit a place with a nice icefall. 
          I imagine the beauty of ice falling , creating a magical atmosphere full of diamond-like small ice-crystals.
    </p>

    <p>The attraction of such a place will be breathtaking to experience.
       Also the thrilling activities that can be performed. 
       Playing with ice, building a Snow-Man and what not... 
       Being surrounded by cushy piles of ice, jumping in them, fills me with excitement.</p>

    <p> Not only it would allow me to connect with the environment, 
        but it will give me a unique and different way to mother nature.</p>

    <p>  At night, I see myself right by a fireplace, sipping hot coffee, and looking at a starry sky .
         The thought of this dream vacation fills me with happiness and dreams.</p></font>
